# KPay

KPay is an e-money android application prototype, written in plain native Java code, that is meant to simplify and speed up payments. Inspired by some big fintech companies, KPay focuses and emphasizes on security and technology. The application uses QR codes and NFC to handle transactions without ignoring the importance of security. 

Some of KPay's main features are:
- Making payments on every KPay supported merchants and vendors.
- Easy top-up via your favorite bank account.
- Easy transfers between KPay accounts.
